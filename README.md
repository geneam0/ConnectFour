# ConnectFour
# compiling:
-  works with a make file
# run different searches:
- in the main.cpp we have commented parts of our function calls:
- for example //bfsnode.BFS(user)
- simply uncomment and you will be able to run

# creating different boards:
-declare a board and treeNode pointer
-then add pieces to board using addPiece(turn, column_number); 
-then set the Board of the treeNode by using treeNodeName->setBoard(board);
-the bfs and iterative deepening algorithms are MEMBER functions
-DFS and Minimax are NON MEMBER functions

# PLEASE refer to presentation to see demos of the code:
- we were able to compile and run, and so we inserted screenshots of the searches working in our presentation
